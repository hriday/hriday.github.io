title: Planning for 2023 
---

Coming into the office after a long weekend is hard. I mean, it's hard anyway, but now, there's so much to do in 2023, the whole day gets taken away in planning and prioritizing. Overall it was productive, but exhausting. I did get to do some DNS work though, which was fun.
