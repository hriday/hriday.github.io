title: A New Year
---

Not blogged in over a decade so this muscle will need to be rebuild. It's a pity that Twitter crashed and burned. It was a crazy place, but it did have some value until all the cool people left this past year. 

In 2023, the resolutions are more or less the same. Read more, learn more and think about the bigger picture more. I keep telling people at work to begin with the end in mind, but I need ot remind myself of the same. 

Books I am currently reading:

* Thermae Romae : A fun manga from a decade ago that I got for Christmas. It's got some cool art.
* The Pringes, Mangonkar : An out of print classic from one of my favourite authors.
* The End of the World in Just the Beginneng; Zeihan : A new book from strategist and thinker, Peter Zeihan. I don't agree with everything he says, but I find myself in a dialogue with him as I read the book, so that's cool.
